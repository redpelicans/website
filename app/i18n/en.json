        "H2": "Back on the server",
        "P2": "Javascript is back on the server.<br />This isn't a new phenomenon; Netscape already stuck Javascript in the server way back in 1996. The emergence of new frameworks like NodeJS or the new breed of NOSQL databases like MongoDB are likely to prove that Javascript, given the quality and speed of resulting apps, is about to become a major server-side language."

        "H2": "NoSQL is about performance and scalability",
        "P2": "Because the way they are structured, relational databases usually scale vertically – a single server has to host the entire database to ensure reliability and continuous availability of data. This gets expensive quickly, places limits on scale, and creates a relatively small number of failure points for database infrastructure.<br />The solution is to scale horizontally, by adding servers instead of concentrating more capacity in a single server. NoSQL databases are cloud-friendly, offering high performance, high availability of data and high scalability at a little cost.",
        "H3": "NoSQL is agile and pragmatic",
        "P3": "Long gone is the twelve-to-eighteen month waterfall development cycle. Now small teams work in agile sprints, iterating quickly and pushing code every week or two, even every day. Relational databases requires schemas and may cause significant downtime each time a migration is needed. NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. That makes it easy to make significant application changes in real-time, without worrying about service interruptions – which means development is faster, code integration is more reliable, and less database administrator time is needed.",
        "H4": "MongoDB is cost-friendly",
        "P4": "MongoDB is free, No more license.<br />Deploying MongoDB drastically lowers operational costs, since it's free, it's reduce administration time and it's speed up development time because it maps directly stored data to objects in modern objects-oriented languages.",
        "H5": "MongoDB is our choice",
        "P5": "Among all the NoSQL databases",
        "P5": "MongoDB is technically on the cutting edge, has the largest and the most active community and is backed by a solid company even if the technology is open-source. <strong>We also have a 7 man-year experience implementing a portfolio management system that relies on MongoDB, that make us confident and fluent about the technology.</strong>",
        "P6": "<span>MongoDB is currently used by big names, such as Cisco, LinkedIn, SAP and MTV.</span><br /><br /> But, NoSQL is a completely new approach and may not suit all the cases, we can help to understand it better and offer you some guidance in your decision making."

        "H2": "A picture is worth a thousand words.",
        "P2": "The ability to understand and extract value from data is hugely easier and efficient when done through a Data Visualization rather than from looking at the raw data. It exposes something new about the underlying patterns and relationships contained within the data.",

        "H4": "Cost-effective and relevant",
        "P4": "D3.js is not a graphics library, nor a data processing library. It does not have pre-built charts that limit creativity. Instead, it has tools that make the connection between data and graphics easy. It sits right between the two, the perfect place for a library meant for data-visualization.",

        "H2": "Backed by Google",

        "H3": "Increase productivity, reducing costs",
        "P3": "Having the ability to scaffold a project quickly with all that you need is key to getting started and producing efficiently. AngularJS came about to standardize web application structure and provide a future template for how client-side apps should be developed. This not only allows you to quickly assemble something up, but it lays the roots for something way bigger to evolve.",
        "H4": "Focus on testing",
        "P4": "Having testable code is part of AngularJS philosophy.<br />Making it easy to write tests is crucial.<br />No matter how good the code is – if it’s not testable, it’s useless in the long run.",

They double the requests per second and decrease by 35% the average response time.<br />Groupon has decrease by 50% the loading time of their pages after rewrote their application server with NodeJS.<br /><strong>We became 6 times faster after a migration from MySQL/Rails to MongoDB/NodeJS.</strong><br />LinkedIn moved from Rails to NodeJS and have a 27 servers cut (on 30).<br />The ability to process many requests/seconds with low response times make NodeJS a great choice for modern web applications that do lots of I/O processing on the client.",
        "H3": "High productivity",
        "P3": "Paypal observes that a NodeJS application is built almost twice as fast with fewer people.<br />The NodeJS ecosystem is extremely prolific: new tools appear almost every day, increasing productivity. More than 65000 modules are currently available and its growth rate is faster than other’s ecosystems.<br />Since the framework was built for the commonly used JavaScript, the barriers to entry are remarkably low<br />and using one language allows code reuse between client and server, reducing the gap among front-end and back-end developers, introducing full stack developers.",
        "H4": "Flexible and Cost effective",
        "P4": "JavaScript is widely standardized, simple and has a quick learning curve that implies easy and natural migration from more complex languages.<br />One language all the way down makes it easier for a single programmer to work on either side of the wire; there's less of a mental shift.<br />For project managers, the trend would make it easier to move developer resources between the front end and the back end if a common language is used on both.",
        "H5": "Polyvalent and attractive",
        "P5": "There are numerous domains where NodeJS can be the right choice (if not the best): Rich Web Applications, Data-Visualization, E-Commerce, Payment processing, Social media, Real-time services.<br />By mastering streams, NodeJS has all the keys to perfectly handle medias (videos, audios).<br />In addition, choosing NodeJS is the guarantee to attract great developers, who are versatile, agile and able to build great applications in less time due to their broad spectrum of knowledge and skills.",
        "P6": "NodeJS use non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.<br /><br /><span>You want fast and scalable network applications, you want real-time web.</span><br /><br />We can bring you all through our NodeJS expertise just in a blink of an eye."
